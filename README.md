## Intro

This repo contains a collection of documented steps and configuration files for [self-hosting GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/) on your Linux server using Docker.
It also includes [GitLab runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/) configurations that enable automatic application deployment with [GitLab's CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), all containerized within Docker.

This was primarily intended for myself and for future instances of myself, whenever I might need to set up a server with this configuration.<br>
But why not just make it public? That way, I'll be forced to put more effort into it, and even I'll benefit from it in the future.
